Properties
==========

Inscriptions may include [CBOR](https://cbor.io/) properties, stored as data
pushes in fields with tag `17`. Since data pushes are limited to 520 bytes,
CBOR longer than 520 bytes must be split into multiple tag `17` fields, which
will then be concatenated before decoding.

Properties are a structured counterpart to [metadata](metadata.md). While
metadata may contain arbitrary CBOR which has no protocol-defined meaning and
is presented on `/inscription` as HTML, properties have protocol-defined
meaning and must conform to a strict schema.

Indefinite-length types are not supported. All maps, arrays, byte strings, and
text strings must be definite.

The non-normative [CDDL](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610) schema
of the properties value is as follows:

```cddl
Properties = {
  ? 0: [*GalleryItem],
  ? 1: Attributes,
  * any => any,
}

GalleryItem = {
  ? 0: bytes .size (32..36), ; inscription ID
  ? 1: Attributes,
  * any => any,
}

Attributes = {
  ? 0: text, ; title
  ? 1: text, ; description
  ? 2: text, ; author
  ? 3: [+ uri], ; links
  ? 4: Traits, ; traits
}

Traits = {
  * text => Value
}

Value =
  Proportion / ; progress bar
  bool / ; "yes" or "no"
  bytes / ; hex
  float / ; decimal
  integer / ; integer
  tdate / ; date-time string
  text / ; text
  time / ; date-time string from epoch timestamp
  uri ; <a> tag

Proportion = #6.6582895(float) ; value may be between 0 and 1 inclusive
InscriptionId = #6.6582896(bytes .size (32..36)) ; links to `/inscription/<id>`
RuneId = #6.6582897([integer, integer]) ; links to `/rune/<id>`
```

The above CDDL schema is provided as a convenience. As always, the ordinals
reference implementation `ord` is the normative specification of inscriptions,
and thus the properties field.

Fields matching the `* any => any` wildcard must be ignored, for compatibility
with future additions.

Galleries
=========

Inscriptions whose properties field contains `GalleryItem`s are galleries.

Galleries contain `GalleryItem`s, whose only defined key `0` contains a
serialized inscription ID. Inscription ID `TXIDiINDEX` is serialized as a byte
string containing the 32 byte TXID, concatenated with by the four-byte
little-endian `INDEX`. Trailing zeros may be removed from four-byte `INDEX`, so
IDs ending in `i0` may be serialized in 32 bytes.

Gallery items are displayed on the inscriptions `/inscription` page on the
explorer.

Galleries are similar to children, in that they provide a way to create
collections of inscriptions. However, galleries are permissionless. Anyone may
create a gallery including any inscriptions. Thus, inclusion in a gallery does
not imply provenance. Additionally, because of this, inclusion in a gallery
does not create a backlink from the gallery item's `/inscription` page to the
gallery.

Galleries may be created when batch inscribing with `ord wallet batch` by
including an array of string inscription IDs of under the `gallery` key of the
inscription entry in the batch file, or when using `ord wallet inscribe` using
the `--gallery` option.
